# PicoLimbo

PicoLimbo is a **high-performance Minecraft limbo server** built entirely in **Rust**, offering an ultra-lightweight
solution for temporary player holding in Minecraft networks. It's designed to be fast, efficient, and compatible with
all Minecraft versions from 1.7.2 through the [latest supported version](./supported-versions).

## What is a Limbo Server?

A **limbo server** is a minimal, often void-world server environment used to temporarily hold players instead of
disconnecting them. Some example use cases includes:

- Authentication server
- Server restarts or maintenance
- AFK (Away From Keyboard) management
- Lobby overflow situations
- Graceful handling of server crashes

Unlike traditional servers, limbo servers are designed to be **resource-efficient**, maintaining player connections
without consuming significant system resources.

## What PicoLimbo Will Not Do

- Replace your main game server
- Support plugins or mods
- Replicate all Minecraft features
- Generate, load or interact with a world

## Why PicoLimbo Over Other Alternatives?

* PicoLimbo supports even more features that NanoLimbo or Limbo combined.
* PicoLimbo is also extremely lightweight, as shown in [the benchmarks](./benchmarks).
* Every feature can be customized via the [configuration file](/config/introduction).
